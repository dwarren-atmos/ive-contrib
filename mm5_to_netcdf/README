 MM5 format to netcdf format converter.

 1) Should read both V2 and V3 formats.
 2) Reads normal and gzipped inputs.
 3) compresser utility will reduce size of data to 2 byte precision
    using add_offset and scale_factor attributes for 2D and 3D vars.

 To compile please edit ARCH.opt file to reflect your machine
 settings. Should compile without warnings on Linux.

 No warranty is given and You can use as You like.

   Graziano.
